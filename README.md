# Fair Weather App

![Fair Weather App Demo](demo.gif)

## Summary  

Hosted: [Fair Weather App](https://fair-weather-app.netlify.app/)

The **Fair Weather App** is my weather companion project that goes beyond forecasts. It helps quickly decide if conditions are right for activities like **dog walking, motorcycle riding, or lawn mowing**, while giving a **visual and customizable experience**.  

I originally built this for personal use, but it‚Äôs grown into a **user-based platform** with:  
- **Customizable metrics** (choose units in ¬∞C/¬∞F, miles/km, time ranges, and thresholds).  
- **User-uploaded images** triggered by weather conditions (rain, visibility, UV, etc).  
- **Authentication with Supabase**, including signup, login, and password recovery.  
- **Default Dobermann-themed AI images** if you don‚Äôt upload your own.  
- **Responsive design**, with different layouts for desktop and mobile.  

It combines **WeatherAPI** for forecasts, **Supabase** for auth and storage, and a **React + Vite frontend** for speed and responsiveness.

## Features

- üîë **Authentication** ‚Äì Signup, login, logout, and password reset

- ‚öôÔ∏è **User Preferences** ‚Äì Customize metrics, thresholds, and display hours

- üé® **Custom Uploads** ‚Äì Add your own images for specific triggers (rain, UV, etc)

- üì± **Responsive Design** ‚Äì Different experiences for desktop and mobile

- ‚è±Ô∏è **Performance** ‚Äì Debounced searches and optimized API calls

## Challenges & Learnings

- **TypeScript Adoption**
My first project using TypeScript ‚Äì I had to learn type annotations, interfaces, and strict type checking while still moving quickly.

- **From Static Prototype ‚Üí User Platform**
It started as a hardcoded personal project, but expanding it to support auth, user preferences, and database storage meant redesigning state management and building a proper schema in Supabase.

- **Authentication & Database Integration**
Implementing secure signup/login with auto-provisioned rows for new users was a milestone. Adding ‚Äúforgotten password‚Äù recovery gave me hands-on experience with Supabase Auth.

- **Custom File Uploads**
Letting users upload their own images for conditions like rain, fog, or high UV required learning how to handle file uploads in Supabase and dynamically render them in React.

- **Responsive Design & UX**
Providing different layouts for desktop and mobile was more than just CSS tweaks. Once I added user uploads and preferences, it became a real design challenge to keep both versions clean and usable.

- **Performance & API Usage**
To avoid hammering WeatherAPI, I implemented debounced search inputs and optimized fetches to balance responsiveness with efficiency.

- **Deployment Pipeline**
Making everything work with Vite, Netlify, serverless functions, and Supabase taught me a lot about environment variables, auth in production, and smooth deployment workflows.

## Future Improvements

- Toggle settings on or off

- Create your own AI images for custom triggers

- User profile with account settings

- Allow users to choose the amount of forecasted days (default 3)

- Multiple saved profiles/ themes (e.g., Dog Walking vs Motorcycle Riding)

- Notifications/reminders based on weather conditions
